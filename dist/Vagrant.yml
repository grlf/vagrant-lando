## To override any of the options below, create a Vagrant.local.yml and modify
## it as you see fit.
vb:
  ## The hostname you'd like for this VM.
  hostname: vagrant-lando.local

  ## The exact version of Lando you want to install. Check out the Releases
  ## page on GitHub if you are unsure: https://github.com/lando/lando/releases
  lando_version: v3.0.0-rc.19

  ## The ports you would like forwarded to your local host, in the format
  ## 'xxxx:yyyy', where xxxx is the port on your host and yyyy is the port in
  ## the vagrant vm.
  ports:
    - '80:80'

  ## Which vagrant box to use
  box: ubuntu/xenial64

  ## Number of CPUs to give to the VM.
  cpus: 1

  ## How much memory (in MB) to give to the VM.
  memory: 2048

  ## How big to make the hard drive. You can specify the size as a raw number
  ## (in bytes) or using KB, MB, GB or TB. See the vagrant-disksize plugin
  ## for more details here: https://github.com/sprotheroe/vagrant-disksize
  disksize: 20GB

  ## Method used for synced folders. The default (empty) is to use the VM
  ## Providers' file sharing method. Other valid values include nfs, smb, or
  ## rsync. The slowest option is to leave this blank. 'rsync' is the fastest but
  ## needs to be manually synced. 'nfs' on Mac and 'smb' on Windows are usually
  ## a good balance of performance and convenience.
  sync: ''
